    content: `FLUTTER BASIC CONCEPTS :

1. What is Flutter?
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit (SDK) created by Google. It is used to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

2. What are the key features of Flutter?
• Cross-platform development
• Hot reload for quick updates
• Fast performance with native ARM code
• Rich widget library
• Beautiful UI with Material & Cupertino widgets
• Open-source & backed by Google

3. What is Dart and why is it used in Flutter?
Dart is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Google. It’s used in Flutter because it supports:
• Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation
• Fast startup and performance
• Reactive programming model suitable for UI

4. What are the advantages of using Flutter?
• Single codebase for multiple platforms
• Faster development with hot reload
• Customizable and expressive UI
• Native-like performance
• Large community support

5. What is Android Studio, and how is it used in Flutter?
Android Studio is an IDE developed by Google for Android development. In Flutter, it’s used to:
• Write, edit, and run Dart code
• Manage Flutter and Dart SDKs
• Run simulators/emulators
• Debug apps with tools like Flutter Inspector

6. How do you install Flutter and test its setup?
• Step 1: Download Flutter SDK from flutter.dev
• Step 2: Extract and add to system PATH
• Step 3: Run flutter doctor in terminal
• Step 4: Install missing dependencies (Dart, Android Studio, etc.)
• Step 5: Create a new project and run using emulator or device

7. What is the difference between Flutter and React Native?
Feature                Flutter                        React Native
Language               Dart                           JavaScript
Performance            Near-native, faster            Good, but uses JavaScript bridge
UI                     Custom widgets                Uses native components
Learning curve         Slightly steep (Dart)         Easier (JavaScript)

8. What are the differences between web applications and mobile applications?
Feature                Web Application               Mobile Application
Platform               Runs in browser               Runs on mobile OS
Installation           No installation needed        Requires installation
Access                 URL-based                     Icon/app-based
Performance            Slower than native apps       Generally faster

9. What is the purpose of a simulator and emulator for Flutter?
• They simulate real devices for testing without physical hardware.
• Emulators (Android) and simulators (iOS) let developers run and debug apps easily.

10. Which tools are commonly used in the Flutter development environment?
• Flutter SDK
• Dart SDK
• Android Studio / VS Code
• Emulators/Simulators
• Flutter DevTools
• Git (for version control)
• Firebase (for backend integration)`
